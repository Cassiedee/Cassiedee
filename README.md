### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I code on occasion, believe it or not. I'm a dedicated person to learning the workings of digital security and information security. I am currently attending the University of California, Los Angeles majoring in, you guessed it, Computer Science. I have most of the CompTIA+ Certifications out of the way. I'm just missing CASP+, PenTest+, and CTT+ from with the suite. I am also working towards getting a CEHv11 certification in addition to the rest of CompTIA+. Fun Fact: I used to be infatuated into pursuing a carrer in the beauty industry until I realized that it wasn't worthwhile. If you would like to contact me, feel free to message me on **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cassidy-nguyen-99877a1a7/)**.
